But these disparate records are not mutually inclusive and cannot be easily cross referenced. They are also limited in scope and lacking in transparency. This database is synthesis of secondary sources, including pre-existing datasets, news articles, and press releases. {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} # Deadly Force The most comprehensive publicly available dataset on police killings in Canada is the [Deadly Force database](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/fatalpoliceencounters/) was collected by the Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC). Initially published in 2018, it was updated July 23, 2020. ## Lack of Access and Transparency {: .no_toc } The CBC would not share their original dataset from the 2018 article that had location based information. However, they had previously shared it with [Pivot Legal](https://www.pivotlegal.org/17_years_of_police_violence_in_canada). I reached out to Pivot Legal, and they were willing to share it with me. ## The CBC Dataset is Highly Flawed {: .no_toc } 1) The CBC has not: disclosed the specifics of their methodology, defined what qualifies as a police killing or a police-involved death, or provided sources for their data. 2) The data are not regularly updated. The dataset was initially published in [2018](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-custom/deadly-force), but was not updated again for two and a half years. The updates coincided with media attention surrounding the Black Lives Matter protests in summer 2020, and to date the CBC has no plans of updating it further. 3) There are many missing/incomplete records in their data. * The CBC database has missing incidents entirely, including: multiple shootings, tazings, and beatings, a death from a police dog, and [starlight tours](https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/the-police-4-starlight-tours/). A starlight tour is when police abduct Indigenous individuals and drop them off in rural areas. When done in the winter, some victims freeze to death. * I asked the CBC why the starlight tour deaths of Rodney Naistus and Lawrence Wegner in January and February 2000 at the hands Saskatoon Police officers were not included in the database. * *\"While their deaths were very likely a result of starlight tours by the Saskatoon police, they were not added to the database because there is no record of police officers picking them up. The inquests into their deaths were also inconclusive. Because of the lack of definitive proof, it was decided not to include them in the database.\"* Their response highlights why we cannot rely on a news corporation (especially one funded by the government) to collect and disseminate this type of information. # What Other Information is Available? ## Killer Cops Canada [Killercopscanada](https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/) is a word press blog with posts reporting on police killings **and** police-involved deaths. The blog was started in 2015, but some posts report on historical incidents including a few dating back to the early 1900's. The blog is run by an anonymous user, thus far we have not reached out to them. We have however, written some code to download the posts and parse them using keyword searches to compile them into an indexed dataset of records. ## laCRAP [laCRAP](https://www.lacrap.org/) is a francophone organization that maintains a list of police involved deaths dating back to 1987. The list includes victims names and ages, the date of incidents and the \"circumstances of the death\" (Intervention, In-Custody, Suicide, and Inaction). The list is grouped by city/province, with only the largest cities (Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton, and Vancouver) listed. The list is posted on their website, and is not easily downloadable. However, we have similarly used python to download and parse the list from their webpage. We have yet to contact this organization either, but intend to reach out shortly. # Expanding the Dataset ## Validating and Updating {: .no_toc } Using the Deadly Force dataset as a starting point, we have incorporated the killercopscanada and laCRAPdatasets by cross referencing for matching records. We have added the missing incidents and updated missing information in the CBC data. This database uses a We need a broader, more inclusive account of all deaths that are occurring as a result police **action or inaction**. In addition to killings during arrests by on duty officers, this record includes: ### 1) Killings by off-duty & ex police officers {: .no_toc } * Domestic violence rates among police families are [two to four](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/police-officers-who-hit-their-wives-or-girlfriends/380329/) times higher than they are in the general public. * At least four Canadian police have killed their partners since 2000 [1](https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/10/31/wills_found_guilty_of_murdering_mistress.html) [2](https://globalnews.ca/news/7643929/former-b-c-cop-granted-escorted-temporary-absences/) [3](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ex-rcmp-officer-convicted-of-murder-1.305479) [4](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/former-mountie-found-not-criminally-responsible-in-wife-s-death-1.1304062) * At least one death from a drunk off-duty officer striking a pedestrian.

I work in the UBC Geography Department as a postdoctoral researcher studying climate change and as a sessional instructor teaching Geographic Information Systems. At 19, I was charged with \"possession of a controlled dangerous substance\" (0.5 grams of marijuana) in Maryland, USA. Before that point, I did not fear the police; my whiteness shielded me from their harassment. But after being labeled a \"criminal\", I did get a glimpse how police treatment differed. On multiple occasions, I had police pull me over and detain me without cause while they brought in dogs to search my vehicle. On one occasion an officer approached with his hand on his holster; I believe that if my skin were darker, that pistol would have been drawn and I could have been shot. Moving to Canada, where my \"crime\" is not a crime, I thought \"This place is better than that\". But I could not have been farther from the truth. The reality, is that police violence is pervasive across Canada and I fell for a narrative that has been crafted Canadian institutions; that police violence is \"just and American issue\". My motivation for compiling this database doing is to increase awareness, advocate for accountability, and work to end police violence. ",

    "content": "# Police Killings and Police Involved Deaths in Canada {: .no_toc } Police officers regularly face no consequences for killing members of the public. Hundreds have died at the hands of police in the last decade and little has been done about it. Police institutions have a vested interest in maintaining their status a heavily armed domestic military force and the government has a vested interest in maintaining status quo. It is not surprising a publicly maintained, transparent record of deaths resulting from police action or inaction does not exist in Canada. However, it is an abject failure on the part of government and police institutions. This project is an attempt to work towards promoting greater transparency, with the intention of advocating for accountability and helping to minimize future incidences of police violence. {: .text-delta } 1. TOC {:toc} # Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada? Racism is ingrained in the history of policing in Canada since the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1873. Police in Canada play a central tool in Canada's ongoing genocide of Indigenous people, actively work to oppress BIPOC communities, and maintain systems of oppression in Canadian society. Police institutions exist to do the bidding of those in power, not protect the public. Canadian institutions rely on the lack of race based statistics and other demographic information to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is \"just an American issue\" and that Canada is \"better\". We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable. # Access the Data The Canadian Police Killing and Police Involved Deaths data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Police-Involved-Deaths-CA/Data/tree/main/MostRecentUpdate). ## Notes on Terminology {: .no_toc } **Police Killing:** A death directly resulting from police use of force. Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force. **Police-Involved Deaths** Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police. Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc. This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics. # Spatial Distribution ## By Province {: .no_toc } Ontario and Quebec have the highest numbers, but if normalizing by population highlights that the RCMP, police in the North and West are more predisposed to violence. ## Point Locations {: .no_toc } These location data will be matched with census data to help fill in missing details in the database. Your browser does not support iframes. View page in New Tab # Trends and Demographics ## Increasing Police Violence in Canada {: .no_toc } There has been an alarming increase in deaths at the hands of Canadian Police over recent years. Some of this trend may be due to increased access to information. However, it is doubtufl that more information alone can explain this striking increase. ## Types of Deaths {: .no_toc } **Police Shootings** are the largest proportion of deaths in the database. **Other Killings** include all verified uses of force (tazings, beatings, etc.). **Traffic Incidents** include deaths resulting from police chases and officers hitting pedestrians. **Other Deaths** includes deaths in custody, suicides during police action, and those where details were not released. ## By Race {: .no_toc } The racial breakdown of deaths is **severely** uneven. Minimal information is released about most victims and their race is not specified in over half of incidents. The information we have highlights that Indigenous and Black individuals are severely over-represented. Normalizing by national population totals highlights just how sever the disparity is. **Even** if *All* of the unspecified deaths were white, the death rate would not equal Indigenous or Black individuals. ## By Gender {: .no_toc } There is a severe gender disparity in deaths as well, particularly for police involved killings. # Advocating for Accountability, Attributing Blame As of 2017 (*the most recent data available*), only 14 officers (3%) had been charged for a killing. Regardless of whether an officer is charged with a crime, the departments involved are directly responsible for the deaths of these individuals. ## By Department {: .no_toc } ",
