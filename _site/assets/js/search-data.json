Hundreds have died at the hands of police in the last decade and nothing has been done about it. Police institutions have a vested interest in maintaining their status a heavily armed domestic military force. The government has a vested interest in maintaining status quo. It is not surprising a publicly maintained, publicly accessible record of deaths resulting from police action or inaction does not exist for Canada. But it is an abject failure on the part of Governance. Some attempts have been made at compiling records. But these disparate records are not mutually inclusive and cannot be easily cross referenced. # Deadly Force The most comprehensive publicly available dataset on police killings in Canada is the [Deadly Force database](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/fatalpoliceencounters/) was collected by the Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC). Initially published in 2018, it was updated July 23, 2020. ## Lack of Access and Transparency The CBC would not share their original dataset from the 2018 article that had location based information. However, they had previously shared it with [Pivot Legal](https://www.pivotlegal.org/17_years_of_police_violence_in_canada). I reached out to Pivot Legal, and they were willing to share it with me. ## The CBC Dataset is Highly Flawed 1) The CBC has not: disclosed the specifics of their methodology, defined what qualifies as a police killing or a police-involved death, or provided sources for their data. 2) The data are not regularly updated. The dataset was initially published in [2018](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-custom/deadly-force), but was not updated again for two and a half years. The updates coincided with media attention surrounding the Black Lives Matter protests in summer 2020, and to date the CBC has no plans of updating it further. 3) There are many missing/incomplete records in their data. * The CBC database has missing incidents entirely, including: multiple shootings, tazings, and beatings, a death from a police dog, and [starlight tours](https://www.canadaland.com/podcast/the-police-4-starlight-tours/). A starlight tour is when police abduct Indigenous individuals and drop them off in rural areas. When done in the winter, some victims freeze to death. * I asked the CBC why the starlight tour deaths of Rodney Naistus and Lawrence Wegner in January and February 2000 at the hands Saskatoon Police officers were not included in the database. * *\"While their deaths were very likely a result of starlight tours by the Saskatoon police, they were not added to the database because there is no record of police officers picking them up. The inquests into their deaths were also inconclusive. Because of the lack of definitive proof, it was decided not to include them in the database.\"* Their response highlights why we cannot rely on a news corporation (especially one funded by the government) to collect and disseminate this type of information. # What Other Information is Available? ## Killer Cops Canada [Killercopscanada](https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/) is a word press blog with posts reporting on police killings **and** police-involved deaths. The blog was started in 2015, but some posts report on historical incidents including a few dating back to the early 1900's. The blog is run by an anonymous user, thus far we have not reached out to them. We have however, written some code to download the posts and parse them using keyword searches to compile them into an indexed dataset of records. ## laCRAP [laCRAP](https://www.lacrap.org/) is a francophone organization that maintains a list of police involved deaths dating back to 1987. The list includes victims names and ages, the date of incidents and the \"circumstances of the death\" (Intervention, In-Custody, Suicide, and Inaction). The list is grouped by city/province, with only the largest cities (Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton, and Vancouver) listed. The list is posted on their website, and is not easily downloadable. However, we have similarly used python to download and parse the list from their webpage. We have yet to contact this organization either, but intend to reach out shortly. # Expanding the Dataset ## Validating and Updating Using the Deadly Force dataset as a starting point, we have incorporated the killercopscanada and laCRAPdatasets by cross referencing for matching records. We have added the missing incidents and updated missing information in the CBC data. This database uses a We need a broader, more inclusive account of all deaths that are occurring as a result police **action or inaction**. In addition to killings during arrests by on duty officers, this record includes: ### 1) Killings by off-duty & ex police officers * Domestic violence rates among police families are [two to four](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/police-officers-who-hit-their-wives-or-girlfriends/380329/) times higher than they are in the general public. * At least four Canadian police have killed their partners since 2000 [1](https://www.thestar.com/news/2007/10/31/wills_found_guilty_of_murdering_mistress.html) [2](https://globalnews.ca/news/7643929/former-b-c-cop-granted-escorted-temporary-absences/) [3](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ex-rcmp-officer-convicted-of-murder-1.305479) [4](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/former-mountie-found-not-criminally-responsible-in-wife-s-death-1.1304062) * At least one death from a drunk off-duty officer striking a pedestrian.

Racism is ingrained in the history of policing in Canada since the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1873. Police in Canada play a central tool in Canada's ongoing genocide of Indigenous people, actively work to oppress BIPOC communities, and maintain systems of oppression in Canadian society. Police institutions exist to do the bidding of those in power, not protect the public. Canadian institutions rely on the lack of race based statistics and other demographic information to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is \"just an American issue\" and that Canada is \"better\". As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years. * We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable. ## Notes on Terminology **Police Killing:** A death directly resulting from police use of force. Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force. **Police-Involved Deaths** Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police. Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc. This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics. ## Increasing Police Violence in Canada There has been an alarming increase in deaths at the hands of Canadian Police over recent years. Police and government institutions need to be held account for this. ## Spatial Distribution Police in the North and West are More Violent. # Access the Data The Canadian Police Killing and Police Involved Deaths data can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Police-Involved-Deaths-CA/Data/tree/main/MostRecentUpdate). ## About the Data This dataset was compiled and is currently maintained by June Skeeter: june.skeeter@ubc.ca Contact me if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. I am white settler and immigrant from the United States, working as GIS instructor at UBC. I've complied this data because it is an important issue that does not get the attention it deserves. ",
