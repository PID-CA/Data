# Police Killings and Police Involved Deaths in Canada

**Police Killing:** A death directly resulting from police use of force.  Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force.

**Police-Involved Deaths**  Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police.  Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc.  This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics.  

There has been an increasing trend in deaths at the hands of Canadian Police over recent years.  This may be partly an result of greater access to information, but it is also probable that Canadian Police *are* becoming more violent.
