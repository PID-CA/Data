# Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada?

Racism is ingrained in the history of policing in Canada since the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1873.  Police in Canada play a central tool in Canada's ongoing genocide of Indigenous people, actively work to oppress BIPOC communities, and maintain systems of oppression in Canadian society.  Police institutions exist to do the bidding of those in power, not protect the public.

Canadian institutions rely on the lack of race based statistics and other demographic information to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is "just an American issue" and that Canada is "better".  As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years.  
* We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable.

## Notes on Terminology

**Police Killing:** A death directly resulting from police use of force.  Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force.

**Police-Involved Deaths**  Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police.  Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc.  This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics.  

## Increasing Police Violence in Canada

There has been an alarming increase in deaths at the hands of Canadian Police over recent years.  Police and government institutions need to be held account for this.
