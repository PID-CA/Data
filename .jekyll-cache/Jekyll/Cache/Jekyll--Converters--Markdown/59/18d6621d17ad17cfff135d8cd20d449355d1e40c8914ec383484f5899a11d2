<h1 id="why-police-involved-deaths-in-canada">Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada?</h1>

<p>Racism is ingrained in the history of policing in Canada since the founding of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1873.  Police in Canada play a central tool in Canada‚Äôs ongoing genocide of Indigenous people, actively work to oppress BIPOC communities, and maintain systems of oppression in Canadian society.  Police institutions exist to do the bidding of those in power, not protect the public.</p>

<p>Canadian institutions rely on the lack of race based statistics and other demographic information to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is ‚Äújust an American issue‚Äù and that Canada is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.  As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes-on-terminology">Notes on Terminology</h2>

<p><strong>Police Killing:</strong> A death directly resulting from police use of force.  Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force.</p>

<p><strong>Police-Involved Deaths</strong>  Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police.  Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc.  This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics.</p>

<h2 id="increasing-police-violence-in-canada">Increasing Police Violence in Canada</h2>

<h2 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h2>

<p>This dataset was compiled and is currently maintained by June Skeeter: june.skeeter@ubc.ca  Contact me if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.  I am white settler and immigrant from the United States, working as GIS instructor at UBC.  I‚Äôve complied this data because it is an important issue that does not get the attention it deserves.</p>

<h2 id="positoinality-statement">Positoinality Statement</h2>

<p>At 19, I (June Skeeter) was charged with ‚Äúpossession of a controlled dangerous substance‚Äù (0.5 grams of marijuana) by the state of Maryland, USA.  Before that point, I did not fear the police, my whiteness shielded me from their harassment.  But after being labeled a ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù, I did get a glimpse how police treatment differed.  Police would pull me over and detain me without cause while they brought in dogs to search my vehicle.  Once an officer approached with his hand on his holster, ready to draw.  If I were black, the pistol would likely have been drawn and I may have been shot.  Moving to Canada, where my ‚Äúcrime‚Äù is not a crime, I thought ‚ÄúThis place is better than that‚Äù.  But I could not have been farther from the truth.  I fell for a narrative that has been crafted Canadian institutions, that police violence is ‚Äújust and American issue‚Äù.  The reality, is that there has been an alarming increase in deaths from police encounter across Canada in recent years.  My motivation for creating this dataset is to increase awareness and work to end police violence.</p>
