<p>I will be speaking about police violence today.  This difficult and painful subject may be triggering to some, especially BIPOC individuals.</p>

<h1 id="land-acknowledgement">Land Acknowledgement</h1>
<p>I am speaking to you today from the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish) Nations.</p>

  <li>I encourage each of you to take a moment to explore <a href="https://native-land.ca/">native-land.ca</a>.  This is by no means a definitive source, but it’s a good place to start building an understanding of the Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.</li>

<h1 id="why-police-involved-deaths-in-canada">Why Police-Involved Deaths in Canada?</h1>

<p>Candian instututions rely on the lack of race based statistics to perpetuate a narrative that systemic racism is “just an American issue” and that Canada is “better”.  As a white settler and immigrant from the United States, I fell for that narrative and did not question it for years.</p>
<ul>
  <li>We need to have discussions about systemic racism in Canada and make it part of the public discourse in order to hold Canadian institutions accountable.</li>
</ul>

<!-- - Why me? Why now? Why this? -->

<h1 id="key-points">Key Points</h1>

<p>1) Canadian police-involved deaths: How do they compare to the United States.</p>

<p>2) More about the data: What’s available and what’s lacking?</p>

<p>3) Next steps: Filling gaps and disseminating the information.</p>

<h1 id="notes-on-terminology">Notes on Terminology</h1>

<p><strong>Police Killing:</strong> A death directly resulting from police use of force.  Including but not limited to: shooting, tazing, other use of force.</p>

<p><strong>Police-Involved Deaths</strong>  Any civilian death at the hands of police or in the custody of police.  Includes police killings deaths resulting from police negligence/inaction: suicide, overdoses, medical emergencies, etc.  This is broader term that is more difficult to refute on the grounds of semantics.</p>
